qt4-x11 (4:4.8.7+dfsg-14) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  Since 4:4.8.7+dfsg-13 qt4-x11 is patched to make use of OpenSSL 1.1. As Qt4
  is not supported upstream anymore this patch did not get a full review.
  This is why 4:4.8.7+dfsg-13 was uploaded to experimental first. As we have
  not received any bugs in 4 months we are now pushing this to unstable.
